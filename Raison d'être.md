# The School of Bitcoin's Raison d'être (Reason for Being)

At The School of Bitcoin, our core mission revolves around the principles of inclusivity, decentralisation, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge in the ever-evolving landscape of Bitcoin.

## V4V Open Lessons

Every week, we curate and facilitate interactive lessons that thrive on the collective spirit of our community. These sessions are open to all individuals eager to share and refine their skills and are fueled by the relentless innovation within the realm of Bitcoin. In this dynamic space, we champion a holistic approach to staying well-informed driven by the community's collaborative efforts.

Within this collaborative framework, any enthusiastic participant is encouraged to impart their wisdom during these lessons. Furthermore, they are urged to include their distinctive lightning address in the video and repository, enabling learners to make direct contributions to the instructors. Our ethos is one of reciprocity, encapsulated in the concept of "Value 4 Value."

Discover a bounteous repository of lessons, neatly organised and readily accessible, offering a treasure trove of knowledge and expertise. If you're keen on sharing your own lessons, we warmly invite you to connect with us. These lessons are also mirrored on the Open Bitcoin Channel, expanding their accessibility and ensuring the widespread dissemination of invaluable information. (All videos are backed up to odysee)

## What is Value 4 Value?

The heart of our mission lies in the Decentralised Autonomous Education System (DAES)⚡. DAES empowers aspiring learners with a platform to submit their Bitcoin project ideas, seeking potential funding and mentorship opportunities. Our team of experts spans a diverse range of domains, including Bitcoin, NOSTR, and lightning, providing comprehensive guidance and support for all project proposals. Through the decentralised nature of DAES, we aim to create an inclusive environment where innovative ideas can flourish, receiving the resources needed to transform into successful Bitcoin projects.

Don't hesitate to contact us with your Bitcoin project ideas and explore our mentorship program along with the DAES BTC Learner Fund, creating a dynamic virtual learning space. You can also contribute to the Learner Fund⚡ to support budding Bitcoin enthusiasts in their educational journey.

## Bitcoin: A Unique Path

At The School of Bitcoin, we emphasise the significance of distinguishing Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Bitcoin is not just another digital currency or blockchain; it represents a paradigm shift in the world of finance and decentralisation. Teaching this difference is crucial in fostering a positive and accurate understanding of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the original and most widely recognised cryptocurrency, designed to operate as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its revolutionary technology, powered by the blockchain, has the potential to transform traditional financial systems and offer financial freedom to individuals worldwide. By educating about this distinction, we empower learners to make informed decisions and actively participate in the digital currency revolution.
